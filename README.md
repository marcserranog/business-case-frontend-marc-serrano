# Frontend Engineer Challenge - Movie Wishlist App

## About the Project

Welcome to the **Movie Wishlist App**! This project is created as a frontend challenge to showcase my skills as a Frontend Engineer. The app allows users to browse movies from various categories and add them to their wishlist. The movie data is fetched from **TheMovieDatabase API**, and the app features dynamic carousels, movie details, and a wishlist functionality.

### Key Features:
- **Homepage**: Displays 3 carousels, each showcasing a different movie category (Popular, Top Rated, Upcoming).
- **Item Detail Page**: Clicking on a movie will lead to a detail page where the user can see:
  - A detailed description of the movie.
  - A high-quality image from the movie.
  - A button to "add to wishlist".
- **Wishlist**: A section where users can view all movies they have added to their wishlist.
- **Category-Specific Styling**: The detail page has differentiated styles based on the movie category, including unique fonts and buttons.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive and provides a smooth experience on both mobile and desktop devices.

The app uses modern frontend practices including:
- **React** for building dynamic user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling.
- **Webpack** for bundling the application.
- **Jest** for testing the app.
